We've already talked through most of your code. The main feedback that I have is related to your overall data story. From a business standpoint, age and age group should be roughly interchangeable, so i would focus on Age based on the success of your random forest regressor. For Wednesday, I would spend time reviewing the features from the model and building a narriative around how those features effect the ultimate time it takes to sell the car. Random forest regression is not impossible to explain, and the relationship between the variables should be evident and intuitive, so that should move your project forward significantly.
